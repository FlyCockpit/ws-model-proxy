/**
 * Resolve the real client IP for an anonymous request, accounting for reverse
 * proxies. This is the rate-limit key for traffic that isn't tied to a user id.
 *
 * The TCP socket peer (`getConnInfo`) is the real client ONLY when the app is
 * exposed directly to the internet. In a reverse-proxy deployment, TLS terminates
 * before the app and forwards over a private network — so the socket peer is
 * the proxy, and the client IP lives in `X-Forwarded-For`.
 *
 * `X-Forwarded-For` is `<client-supplied>, <appended by hop 1>, <hop 2>, ...`.
 * The LEFTMOST entry is whatever the client sent (forgeable — keying on it was
 * the original CVE). Each trusted proxy APPENDS the address it received the
 * request from, so the address written by the proxy nearest the app is the
 * rightmost one we should trust.
 *
 * Default (TRUST_PROXY_HOPS unset) — zero config for typical reverse-proxy
 * deployments: walk the `[...X-Forwarded-For, socketPeer]` chain from the right and
 * return the first address that is NOT in a private/loopback/CGNAT range. Those
 * private hops are our own infra (the proxy ⇄ app private network); the first
 * public address is the real client, and it was written by a trusted proxy, so
 * it can't be spoofed by the client. On a bare deployment the socket peer is
 * itself public and is returned directly, so a forged `X-Forwarded-For` is
 * ignored. In local dev there is no `X-Forwarded-For` and the loopback socket
 * peer is used.
 *
 * Escape hatch (TRUST_PROXY_HOPS = N) — for a proxy with a PUBLIC IP (e.g.
 * Cloudflare) or any fixed topology where the heuristic can't tell infra from
 * client: take the entry exactly N hops from the right. N = 0 always keys on
 * the socket peer and ignores `X-Forwarded-For`.

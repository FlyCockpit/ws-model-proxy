# Next release (after v0.3.1): upgrade notes

Draft notes for the release after v0.3.1 (2026-08-27). They cover the
`:external` consent redesign (#56), the OpenRouter provider type and catalog
(#57), the capacity lease owner (#58), provider URL fixes (#60), the web and MCP
consent surface (#59), and own-key routing (#61). Rename this file to the
version when the release is cut, and paste the sections below into the GitHub
release body (the generated installer notes follow them).

Full behaviour reference: [`docs/external-fallback.md`](../external-fallback.md).

## Before you deploy

- **Set a stop grace of at least 52 s.** The server can take up to 47 s to shut
  down (`PROCESS_SHUTDOWN_DEADLINE_MS`). Docker's default of 10 s cuts the HTTP
  drain and relay close short. Use `docker stop -t 52`, compose
  `stop_grace_period: 52s`, or your platform's equivalent. See
  [README "Deployment requirements"](../../README.md#deployment-requirements).
- **Database sessions are forced to UTC.** Every connection sets
  `TimeZone=UTC` on connect. Raw-SQL clocks (`now()`, `clock_timestamp()`) are
  compared with JavaScript-written `timestamp without time zone` columns and
  depend on it.
- **Transaction-mode poolers are unsupported.** PgBouncer
  `pool_mode=transaction` loses the session settings (`TimeZone`, the sweeper's
  `statement_timeout`). Connect directly or use session pooling.
- **Schema: deploy once with `APPLY_SCHEMA=safe`.** All schema changes in this
  release are additive. `safe` also re-applies the schema hardening that
  carries the grantee trigger fix below; with `APPLY_SCHEMA=off` that fix is
  not installed.

## Breaking changes

- **Plain pool names never leave the deployment.** Provider-backed PRIMARY
  members were moved to the external fallback tier, and fallback was enabled
  on those pools. A pool whose members are all providers must be called as
  `owner/pool:external`; its plain name answers `400 external_required`.
- **API tokens are private-only until a person opts in.** Existing and new
  tokens cannot use external providers until someone turns on "Allow external
  providers" for the token in the dashboard. Allowlist tokens also choose
  which pools may go external. The first time an existing allowlist token is
  enabled it includes **no** pools; check each pool you want.
- **`fallbackForGrantees` is off for every pool,** including existing ones.
  Owners must opt in to pay for grantees' external use.
- **Stored-Responses bindings to provider members created before this release
  are invalidated.** Their follow-ups return "not found".
- **The grant-time egress acknowledgement, grantee notices and email are
  gone.** The old oRPC and MCP arguments (`publicEgressAcknowledged`,
  `publicEgressEnabled`, the privacy-confirm flags) are silently stripped. Use
  `fallbackEnabled`, `fallbackForGrantees` and `externalAfterWaitMs` on the
  pool procedures.
- **Context-ceiling requests on plain names now fail** instead of falling back
  to a provider. With `:external` and token consent they may go external.
- **A wait budget of 0 means "admit only if a slot is free right now"**
  (measured on the database clock). Before, it effectively never admitted.
- **New response headers:** `x-wsmp-route` (`local | pool-fallback |
  own-key`), `x-wsmp-fallback-reason`, `x-wsmp-served-model`, and
  `x-wsmp-fallback: unavailable`. The response `model` field is the served
  upstream model id.
- **Own-key routing (BYOK).** Grantees can route `owner/pool:external`
  through their own provider key. The pool owner must first declare an
  external-equivalent model. Own-key traffic is billed to the grantee; the
  owner sees only an aggregate count. The own-key provider receives the
  payload **after** the pool's media transformer.
- **OpenRouter accounting is conservative for now.** Until OpenRouter usage
  normalization lands (#62), budgets over-count OpenRouter spend.

## Fixed

- **Grantees of shared pools could not use local members.** Since #26
  (2026-08-25), on databases with schema hardening applied, a grantee's
  request to a shared pool's local member failed: the database rejected the
  request's start record and the request errored. Grantee `:external`
  responses paid by the pool owner were delivered, but their request record
  stayed pending until crash recovery. The `relay_request` consistency trigger
  now checks the selected target against the pool owner for pool routes, and
  against the requester for own-key and direct routes (#61). Deploy with
  `APPLY_SCHEMA=safe` to install it.

## Post-deploy verification

The trigger fix is covered by the PostgreSQL CI suites but has not yet been
observed on a real deployment. After deploying:

- [ ] As a grantee, send one request to a shared pool that a local member
      serves. It succeeds.
- [ ] As a grantee with a token that allows external providers, send one
      `owner/pool:external` request that the pool owner pays for
      (`fallbackEnabled` and `fallbackForGrantees` on). It succeeds with
      `x-wsmp-route: pool-fallback`.
- [ ] Both `relay_request` rows reach a terminal state (not `PENDING`), and
      their selected execution target belongs to the pool owner.
- [ ] Record the result on issue #63.

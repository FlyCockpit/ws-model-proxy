/**
 * Shared locale constants. Imported by both the web app's i18n config and the

 *
 * Adding a locale:
 *   1. Append the BCP 47 tag to `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`.
 *   2. Drop matching translation JSON files into `apps/web/src/locales/<tag>/`.
 * No DB migration is required — `User.locale` is a free-form String column,
 * validated at the API boundary by this list.

# Responsibilities:
#   1. Validate required environment variables.
#   2. Gate schema sync on APPLY_SCHEMA. When sync is requested, run
#      `prisma db push` under a Postgres advisory lock so concurrent replicas
#      (and any accidental cross-image pushes) serialize.
#   3. exec the container CMD.
#
# APPLY_SCHEMA values:
#   off       — skip schema sync. Normal app boot. Default when unset.
#   safe      — run `prisma db push`. Prisma refuses destructive operations
#               (drop column, narrow type, etc.) and exits non-zero.
#   dangerous — run `prisma db push --accept-data-loss`. Destructive operations
#               are applied.
